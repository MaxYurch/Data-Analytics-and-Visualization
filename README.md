SQL and Tableau: Data Visualization project for Market Expansion (Team-Project)

# Case Study: Eniac Market Expansion to Brazil

## Summary
Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. The company is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian tech market. They are interested in Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.

 There are two main concerns:

1. Is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products?
2. Are orders delivered on time?

Conclusion:
- Magist is not a seller specialized in technology, as less than 20% of the total products are tech products, and most are considered cheap.
- Magist is great at delivering their products on time and has fantastic customer happiness.

**We would recommend comparing Magist with a company that specializes in high-end tech products and see how their delivery and customer happiness compare to Magist.**

## Languages and Libraries Used
- SQL
- Tableau Data Visualization

## Key Learnings
- explored Magist Database with SQL and analyzed their tech products and deliveries 
- created an overview of what the data holds for better understanding
- worked with multiple tables and connected them to answer business questions related to the products, sellers and delivery time
- transferred all the necessary data to Tableau to create insightful visualizations for the presentation
- Collaboratively prepared a team presentation with my fellow Data Analysts, pooling our collective insights and expertise 

## Challenges Overcame
We worked on this project as a team of four Data Analysts. We analyzed the data together to understand it better, divided the work to answer different business questions, and created visualizations. We collaborated on creating the presentation and presented the findings and our conclusion as a team.
